Spotify Playlist Quiz

The Spotify Playlist Quiz is an interactive web application that connects to a user's Spotify account and generates a short quiz based on their playlists. This project was built to create a fun and engaging way for users to test their knowledge of their own music taste. After logging in with Spotify, users can select one of their playlists, and the app will randomly pick songs from it. A 5-second audio clip of each song will be played, and the user must correctly guess which song it is

Update: The project has since be depricated due to Spotify's removal of thier API capabilities (Nov. 27, 2024).
